# Plan: [Feature / Bug Title]

**Derived from:** `02-design/output/spec.md`  
**Status:** draft | approved  
**Implementer:** [Engineer]  

## 1. Files That Change
List of exact file paths to create, edit, or delete.

## 2. Order of Work
1. Step 1...
2. Step 2...
3. Step 3...

## 3. Risks & Blast Radius
Potential regressions or dependencies to monitor.

## 4. Proof of Correctness
- Unit tests to run:
- Reproduction test (for fixes, locked before code modification):
- Verification command (`make test`, `npm test`, etc.):

## 5. Implementation Checklist
Lives in `checklist.json` (definitions with id/description/verify); mark items only with `sdlc.py mark`. Give an item a `check` (argv + timeout) whenever an automated proof exists; `verify` then runs it and no mark is needed.
